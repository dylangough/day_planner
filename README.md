# Fully Functional Day Planner

    This planner was created in HTML5 with CSS elements incorporated as well as JQUERY.
    The fully functional day planner consists of a jumbotron with the work day scheduler as a title, and the explanation for what it does underneath.
    Below that is the current Date along with the current time that dynamically updates as you stay on the page or refresh it.
    Under the line break comes the card with the weekly schedule with time slots from 9am to 10pm.
    They are spaced out by each hour.
    Below the times are two buttons that include saving the schedule and the next button retrieving the previously saved schedule.
